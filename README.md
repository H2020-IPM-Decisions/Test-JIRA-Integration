# Test-JIRA-Integration
This is created only to test the JIRA integration. Should be deleted as soon as we have something operational

Integration steps
1) I cloned this repo to my PC
2) I edited this file
3) I committed and pushed this, including a reference to a JIRA issue:
	commit -m 'Testing, referencing this commit to [IDEC-79]' README.md
4) Haven't made this work yet!
